Description: This package implements an empirical Bayes, multi-state Cox model. 
Different groups of regression coefficients can be defined, with coefficients of the same group sharing the same Gaussian prior. 
It takes as input a data set in 'long format' and generates estimates of relative hazards, cumulative hazard functions and transition probabilities.
