\title{Covariance-based imputation of missing variables}
\usage{
ImputeMissing(X, newX = X, use = "pairwise.complete.obs",
  bound = TRUE)

ImputeXMissing(X, newX = X, use = "pairwise.complete.obs",
  bound = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{orignial data set}

\item{newX}{The data.frame of covariates}

\item{use}{character Which observations to use for computing the covariance. See cov() for details.}

\item{bound}{logical. Determines whether the imputations should be bound to the range of the variable observed in the original data set.}
}
\value{
A data.frame of dim(newX) with imputed variables
}
\description{
This functinon imputes missing variables based on the covariance of a previous data set.
This can be useful if a CoxRFX model (or any other) has been fit on a large data set with
correlated variables and one wants to use this model on a different data sets with fewer 
or randomly missing covariates.
